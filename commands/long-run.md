# /long-run Command

Claude Code slash command that puts the Team Lead in autonomous mode, processing beans from the backlog until the backlog is empty or no actionable beans remain. Supports sequential (default) and parallel (`--fast N`) modes.

## Purpose

Automates the manual loop of picking a bean, decomposing it into tasks, executing the team wave, verifying results, and committing — then moving on to the next bean. The Team Lead selects beans based on priority, dependencies, and logical ordering.

## Usage

```
/long-run [--fast N] [--category <cat>]
```

- `--fast N` -- Run N beans in parallel using tmux child windows (optional).
- `--category <cat>` -- Only process beans matching this category: `App`, `Process`, or `Infra` (case-insensitive, optional).

## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Backlog | `ai/beans/_index.md` | Yes (must exist with at least one actionable bean) |
| Bean workflow | `ai/context/bean-workflow.md` | Yes (reference for lifecycle) |
| tmux session | Environment (`$TMUX`) | Required only when `--fast` is used |

## Process

### Phase 0: Branch Prerequisite

0. **Ensure on `main` branch** — Run `git branch --show-current`.
   - If already on `main`: proceed.
   - If on another branch with a clean working tree: run `git checkout main` and proceed.
   - If the working tree is dirty: display "⚠ /long-run requires a clean working tree on the `main` branch. Current branch: `<branch>`. Please switch to `main` and retry." Then stop.

1. **Read backlog** — Parse `ai/beans/_index.md`. Identify beans with status `Approved`.
2. **Check for actionable beans** — If no beans are actionable (all `Done`, `Deferred`, or blocked by dependencies), report "Backlog clear — no actionable beans" and stop.
3. **Select best bean** — Apply selection heuristics (see Options below) to choose the single best bean to work on next.
4. **Pick the bean** — Update status to `In Progress` in `bean.md`. Update `_index.md` on `main` to set status to `In Progress` and owner to `team-lead`.
5. **Create feature branch from `test`** — `git fetch origin && git checkout -b bean/BEAN-NNN-<slug> origin/test`. All work for this bean happens on this branch.
6. **Decompose into tasks** — Read the bean's Problem Statement, Goal, Scope, and Acceptance Criteria. Create numbered task files in the bean's `tasks/` directory. Default wave: Developer → Tech-QA. Include BA or Architect only when their inclusion criteria are met. Tech-QA is mandatory for every bean.
7. **Execute the wave** — Process each task in dependency order:
   - Read the task file and all referenced inputs
   - Produce the required outputs in `ai/outputs/<persona>/`
   - Update the task status to `Done`
8. **Verify acceptance criteria** — Check every criterion in the bean's AC list. Run tests and lint if applicable.
9. **Close the bean** — Update status to `Done` in `bean.md`. (The orchestrator updates `_index.md` after the merge — see step 11.)
10. **Commit on feature branch** — Stage all changed files and commit with message: `BEAN-NNN: <title>`. The commit goes on the `bean/BEAN-NNN-<slug>` branch.
11. **Merge to `test` and update index** — Execute `/internal:merge-bean NNN --target test` to merge the feature branch into `test`. The merge-bean skill returns to `main` after merging. Then update `_index.md` on `main` to set the bean's status to `Done`, commit, and push. If merge conflicts occur, report and stop. *(In parallel mode, workers do NOT merge or edit `_index.md` — the orchestrator handles both after each worker completes.)*
12. **Stay on main** — Remain on the `main` branch.
13. **Report progress** — Summarize what was completed: bean title, tasks executed, branch name, merge commit, files changed.
14. **Loop** — Go back to step 1. Continue until no actionable beans remain. When complete, display: `All work merged to test.`

## Output

| Artifact | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Task files | `ai/beans/BEAN-NNN-<slug>/tasks/` | Decomposed tasks for each bean |
| Persona outputs | `ai/outputs/<persona>/` | Work products from each task |
| Updated beans | `ai/beans/BEAN-NNN-<slug>/bean.md` | Status updates through lifecycle |
| Updated index | `ai/beans/_index.md` | Status changes for processed beans |
| Git commits | Git history | One commit per completed bean |
| Progress report | Console output | Summary after each bean completes |

## Options

### Bean Selection Heuristics

The Team Lead selects the next bean using these criteria in priority order:

| Priority | Criterion | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Explicit priority** | High > Medium > Low |
| 2 | **Inter-bean dependencies** | If BEAN-X depends on BEAN-Y, do Y first |
| 3 | **Logical ordering** | Infrastructure before features, data models before UI |
| 4 | **ID order** | Lower IDs first (tiebreaker) |

Dependencies between beans may be stated in the bean's Notes section or Scope section. The Team Lead should read candidate beans to assess implicit dependencies even when not explicitly stated.

### Parallel Mode (`--fast N`)

When `--fast N` is specified, the Team Lead orchestrates N parallel workers instead of processing beans sequentially.

**tmux detection:**
1. Check if `$TMUX` environment variable is set.
2. If not in tmux, display: "Parallel mode requires tmux. Please restart Claude Code inside a tmux session and re-run `/long-run --fast N`."
3. If in tmux, proceed with worker spawning.

**Worker spawning (worktree-based):**
1. Select up to N independent beans from the backlog (beans with no unmet inter-bean dependencies). Pre-assign all beans — the orchestrator selects them upfront.
2. For each selected bean, create an isolated git worktree, write an initial status file, and spawn a tmux worker:
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   BEAN_LABEL="BEAN-NNN"
   BEAN_SLUG="BEAN-NNN-slug"
   WORKTREE_DIR="/tmp/foundry-worktree-${BEAN_LABEL}"
   BRANCH_NAME="bean/${BEAN_SLUG}"
   STATUS_FILE="/tmp/foundry-worker-${BEAN_LABEL}.status"

   # Clean stale worktree from a prior run
   git worktree remove --force "$WORKTREE_DIR" 2>/dev/null

   # Create feature branch + worktree
   if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/${BRANCH_NAME}"; then
     git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" "$BRANCH_NAME"
   else
     git fetch origin && git worktree add -b "$BRANCH_NAME" "$WORKTREE_DIR" origin/test
   fi

   cat > "$STATUS_FILE" << EOF
   bean: ${BEAN_LABEL}
   title: (starting)
   tasks_total: 0
   tasks_done: 0
   current_task:
   status: starting
   message:
   worktree: ${WORKTREE_DIR}
   updated: $(date -Iseconds)
   EOF

   LAUNCHER=$(mktemp /tmp/foundry-bean-XXXXXX.sh)
   cat > "$LAUNCHER" << 'SCRIPT_EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /tmp/foundry-worktree-BEAN-NNN
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --agent team-lead \
     "Process BEAN-NNN-slug through the full team wave.

   You are running in an ISOLATED GIT WORKTREE. Your feature branch is already checked out.
   - Do NOT create or checkout branches.
   - Do NOT run /internal:merge-bean — the orchestrator handles merging after you finish.
   - Do NOT checkout main — this will fail in a worktree if that branch is checked out elsewhere.
   - Do NOT edit _index.md — the orchestrator is the sole writer of the backlog index.

   1. Update bean.md status to In Progress
   2. Decompose into tasks
   3. Execute the wave (Developer → Tech-QA default; include BA/Architect per criteria)
      — COMMIT AND PUSH after each task. Do not wait until the end.
   4. Verify acceptance criteria
   5. Update bean.md status to Done
   6. Final commit and push on the feature branch

   RELIABILITY: Commit+push after each task. On error: commit what you have, set status to error, EXIT.
   If running for 30+ minutes: commit, set status, exit. Update status file after every task as a heartbeat.

   STATUS FILE PROTOCOL — You MUST update /tmp/foundry-worker-BEAN-NNN.status at every transition.
   See /internal:spawn-bean command for full status file format and update rules."
   SCRIPT_EOF
   chmod +x "$LAUNCHER"
   tmux new-window -n "bean-NNN" "bash $LAUNCHER; rm -f $LAUNCHER"
   ```
   The prompt is passed as a positional argument to `claude`, so it auto-submits immediately. The window auto-closes when claude exits. No stagger delay needed — worktrees provide full isolation. Worker prompts include the status file protocol from `/internal:spawn-bean` (status values: starting, decomposing, running, blocked, error, done).
3. The main window remains the orchestrator — it does not process beans itself.

**Bean assignment rules:**
- Only assign beans that have no unmet dependencies on other in-progress or pending beans.
- If fewer than N independent beans are available, spawn only as many workers as there are beans.
- Never assign the same bean to multiple workers.
- The main window orchestrates only — it does not process beans itself.

**Progress monitoring — continuous assignment dashboard loop:**

After spawning the initial batch of workers, the main window enters a **persistent dashboard loop** that runs until the backlog is exhausted. This is the mechanism that keeps assigning beans — it is not just a passive monitor. See `/internal:spawn-bean` Step 4 for the full specification. **Every iteration** of the loop performs these steps:

1. **Read** all `/tmp/foundry-worker-*.status` files.
2. **Process completed workers** — For each worker showing `status: done` that hasn't been merged: remove the worktree, sync (`git fetch origin && git checkout test && git pull origin test && git checkout main`), run `/internal:merge-bean NNN --target test`, update `_index.md` to `Done` on `main`, commit and push.
3. **Assign replacements** — **Re-read `_index.md` fresh** (not a pre-computed queue). For each empty worker slot, find the next `Approved` unblocked bean. If found: mark it `In Progress` in `_index.md`, create a worktree, spawn a new tmux window.
4. **Render** the dashboard table with progress bars, percentages, and color-coded status.
5. **Alert and recover** — Flag `blocked` (🔴). For `stale` workers (no update for 10+ minutes): kill tmux window, remove worktree, set status to error, log event. Bean stays `In Progress` for retry.
6. **Check exit** — Exit only when **both**: all workers are done/merged, AND no approved beans remain in `_index.md`.
7. **Sleep ~30 seconds**, then repeat from step 1.

The loop runs indefinitely until the backlog is exhausted. There is no maximum bean limit — user can Ctrl-C to stop early.

- To force-kill a stuck worker: `tmux kill-window -t "bean-NNN"`, then `git worktree remove --force /tmp/foundry-worktree-BEAN-NNN`

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--fast N` | Off (sequential) | Run up to N beans in parallel using tmux child windows |
| `--category <cat>` | Off (all beans) | Only process beans matching this category: `App`, `Process`, or `Infra` (case-insensitive) |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `EmptyBacklog` | No beans in `_index.md` | Report "No beans in backlog" and stop |
| `NoActionableBeans` | All beans are `Done`, `Deferred`, or blocked | Report status summary and stop |
| `TaskFailure` | A task's acceptance criteria cannot be met | Report the failure, leave bean as `In Progress`, stop the loop |
| `TestFailure` | Tests or lint fail after implementation | Attempt to fix; if unresolvable, report and stop |
| `MergeConflict` | Git conflict during commit | Report the conflict and stop for manual resolution |
| `NotInTmux` | `--fast` used but `$TMUX` is not set | Instruct user to restart in tmux |
| `WorkerFailure` | A parallel worker fails on its bean | Report which worker/bean failed; other workers continue |

When the loop stops due to an error, the current bean remains `In Progress` so the user can inspect and resume. In parallel mode, a single worker failure does not stop other workers.

## Examples

**Run the full backlog:**
```
/long-run
```
Team Lead reads the backlog, picks the highest-priority unblocked bean, processes it through the default wave (Developer → Tech-QA), commits, and moves on to the next. Continues until backlog is clear.

**Typical output after each bean:**
```
✓ BEAN-007 (Long Run Command) — Done
  Tasks: 01-developer (Done), 02-tech-qa (Done)
  Committed: a1b2c3d
  Remaining: 5 beans (3 actionable)
  Next: BEAN-006 (Backlog Refinement Command)
```

**When backlog is clear:**
```
✓ Long run complete
  Beans processed: 4
  Backlog status: 0 actionable, 2 deferred

  All work merged to test.
```

**Parallel mode with 3 workers:**
```
/long-run --fast 3
```
Team Lead detects tmux, selects 3 independent beans, spawns 3 child windows. Each worker processes one bean on its own feature branch. As workers finish, the Team Lead assigns the next unblocked bean.

**Typical parallel output:**
```
⚡ Parallel mode: 3 workers
  Worker 1: BEAN-012 (User Auth) — In Progress
  Worker 2: BEAN-013 (Dashboard) — In Progress
  Worker 3: BEAN-014 (Mobile API) — In Progress

✓ Worker 2: BEAN-013 (Dashboard) — Done [bean/BEAN-013-dashboard]
  Assigning: BEAN-015 (Notifications) → Worker 2

✓ All workers idle. Long run complete.
  Beans processed: 5 (3 parallel + 2 sequential)
  Backlog status: 0 actionable

  All work merged to test.
```

**Filter by category:**
```
/long-run --category Process
```
Only processes beans with Category = Process. Skips App and Infra beans.

**Parallel + category:**
```
/long-run --fast 3 --category Infra
```
Runs up to 3 Infra beans in parallel, ignoring App and Process beans.
