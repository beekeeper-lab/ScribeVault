I've been like so many times this month. It's probably a new record. No, that's not what I was gonna say. I mean, I could have said that because it'd be true, but I thought the officer reached out to you and told you you didn't have to come back today because we were welcoming back home. Back home. Get some grammar lessons, man. But we're welcoming back. Why is he here? Ricky listen. Most man, please. He's in here for me. I'm here because I value a hard day's work. Hard day's work. Man, you're an electrician. Then the hard day's work you've ever had. It's convincing your wife that man in your phone, you keep texting, is just a friend. I thought that I was hitting you off with a settlement or something so you didn't say when you'd leave. Oh, yes. They were very generous with their offer, but I counter offered. Talk about 30% of what they were offering me. If I got to keep my job.
